Example usage (just to test the route and displaying it with django), navigate to:
    - http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/nonrest

    - http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/rest

Example usage in frontend:
    - create a fetch to either /api/nonrest or /api/rest
    - make sure you .json() your response
    - console.log the json'd response and you shall see the results
